                    <p id="centerje">Born and raised in Panama City, Republic of Panama, Rafael is currently a first-year student at UC Berkeley,
                    aiming to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and work alongside the government and several
                    non-profit organizations to reduce the technological gap in less economically developed countries.</p>
                    <p id="centerje">Rafael is a young amateur photographer that dreams with preserving and extending the presence of indigenous
                    culture, language, and traditions in Latin America. Currently he is working in "Darien: A Project by Rafael Felix", which
                    attempts to accurately depict the everyday life of the Embera Wounnan, one of the largest indigenous groups
                    that still exist in Panama.</p>
                    <p id="centerje">The purpose of this project is to transcend the mission of protecting our indigenous heritage, not only in Panama and
                    Latin America, but across all countries and borders.</p>
                    <p id="centerje">You can see pictures of the Darien project by clicking anywhere outside of this box and clicking on "Projects".</p>
